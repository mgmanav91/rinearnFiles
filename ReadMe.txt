  The downloaded package is compressed by ZIP (extension: .zip) format.
  At first, extract the ZIP file before using, otherwise software will not work correctly.

  * If you opened contents (including this file) of the ZIP file by double-clicking, 
    they are previewed temporary, so the ZIP file is not extracted permanently.


- For Microsoft(R) Windows(R)

  Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and extract it by selecting the right-clicking menu.

  If the extraction finished successfully, the folder with the same name with the ZIP file 
  will be generated, and all contents contained in the ZIP file will be located in the folder.
  Thereafter use files in the folder, so use them.

  * By the way, the extraction may stop with security warning messages (e.g. " ~ potentially harmful"). 
    It may be caused by that the security feature of the OS on your PC detects batch (.bat) files

  Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and extract it by selecting the right-clicking menu, 
  or extract on the command-line terminal as follows:

      cd <the_folder_in_which_the_ZIP_file_is>
      unzip -O cp932 rinearn_graph_3d_???_en.zip       (???: version code)


****************************************************************************************************
* How to Launch RINEARN Graph 3D
****************************************************************************************************

- For Microsoft(R) Windows(R)

    Double-click the batch file "RinearnGraph3D_???.bat" (???: version code) 
    in the extracted folder, and then RINEARN Graph 3D will be launched.


  [ About Java(R) Runtime Environment (JRE) ]

    Java(R) Runtime Environment is required for executing this software. 
    If there are no JRE in your environment (or the location of the JRE is not registered 
    in the environment variable "Path"), you optionally can download JRE to "jre" folder, 
    when this software have been launched at the first time.
    In that case, the JRE will be downloaded to "jre" folder of RINEARN Graph 3D, 
    from the official website of RINEARN ( https://download.rinearn.com/jre/ ).

    That JRE had generated by "jlink" tool of OpenJDK. 
    Information about the copyright and license of the OpenJDK and so on are as follows:

    * See documents in the "jre" folder and README bundled in the JRE for more details.


- For Linux(R), etc.

    Execute the JAR file "RinearnGraph3D.jar" on the command-line terminal as follows:

        cd <the_folder_in_which_the_JAR_file_is>
        java -jar RinearnGraph3D.jar

    If you want to specify the memory usage, execute with -Xmx optiopn:

        java -Xmx512m -jar RinearnGraph3D.jar     (For allocating 512MB)


  [ About Java(R) Runtime Environment (JRE) ]

    For executing this software on Linux(R) and so on, Java(R) Runtime Environment is required separately. 
    If you can use "apt" command on your command-line terminal,  you might install JRE by using apt.

    Firstly, search available packages:

        apt search jre      (or "apt-get" instead of "apt")

    and then install appropriate one, for example:

        sudo apt install default-jre        (or "apt-get" instead of "apt")
    or
        sudo apt install openjdk-?-jre      (?: version numbers)

    Please note that RINEARN Graph 3D will not work on JRE with the name ends with "-headles".
